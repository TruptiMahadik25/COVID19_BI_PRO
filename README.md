 Implementing Visuals
 
Summary Metrics:
KPI Cards: Display the total sum of new cases and new deaths prominently for quick reference.

Pie Charts:
New Cases by Country Code and WHO Region: Show proportions to identify which countries have the highest numbers of new cases.
Cumulative Deaths by Country Code and WHO Region: Highlight the total impact in terms of deaths across countries.

Map Visual:
Geographical Distribution: Use a map to show new deaths and new cases geographically. Size of the bubbles represents the magnitude of cases/deaths, providing a spatial understanding of the data.

Bar Charts:
Cumulative Cases by Country Code: Horizontal bar chart to compare cumulative cases across countries.
New Deaths by Country Code: Vertical bar chart to compare new deaths across countries, sorted in descending order for quick insights.

Filters and Slicers:
WHO Region Slicer: Allow users to filter data by different WHO regions, focusing on specific areas of interest.

Interactivity: Ensure that selecting a region dynamically updates all relevant visuals to reflect data for that region.

Tooltips: Provide detailed information on hover to enhance the depth of information available without cluttering the visuals.
